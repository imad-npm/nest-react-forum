GEMINI.md — Enterprise-Grade Rules (Summary)

Act as a senior enterprise engineer / architect

Read and understand the existing codebase before any decision

Reuse established patterns, abstractions, and conventions

Never introduce parallel architectures or duplicate concepts

Design for scale from day one

Assume growth in users, data, teams, and features

Avoid hard-coded assumptions, global state, and brittle condition logic

Enforce strict architectural boundaries

Clear separation of concerns (API, domain, services, persistence, UI)

No cross-layer shortcuts or leaking responsibilities

Prioritize maintainability over cleverness

Explicit naming, predictable flow, boring code

Small focused modules, composable designs

Enterprise decision-making

Explain reasoning and tradeoffs

Prefer extensible designs over quick wins

Optimize for long-term cost, not short-term speed

Consistency over idealized refactors

Align with the existing system unless change is justified and requested

Production-ready by default

Fail fast, validate at boundaries, meaningful errors

Code must be testable, observable, and safe to evolve

Minimal but meaningful documentation

Document intent and constraints, not obvious logic

Clarity is non-negotiable

If uncertain, slow down and choose the simplest scalable design
